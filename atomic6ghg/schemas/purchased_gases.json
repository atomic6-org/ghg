Ozone depleting substances, such as CFCs and HCFCs, are regulated internationally and are typically excluded from a GHG inventory or reported as a memo item. \n (B) Select the gas you purchase from the drop down menu and the amount purchased for the annual inventory reporting period in the ORANGE cells. \n (C) It is assumed that all gas purchased in the reporting period used and released during the reporting period.  If your business makes bulk purchases and plans on using the gas for several years, divide the bulk amount by the years of usage and report that amount. \n Tip: If you purchase bulk gas, remember to report it for future years as well."
